          My name is Adam Hayward. I recently moved from Dallas, Texas to
          Anchorage, Alaska. I relocated to Anchorage to be near family, and of
          course, for adventures in this huge playground that is America's last
          frontier.

          Prior to moving, I spent the last 8 years as a manager with AT&T,
          supervising a team of up to 25 technitians. While I enjoyed my ride at
          AT&T, I was seeking both a lifestyle change and a career change. I
          learned from my experiences at AT&T, after being exposed to Lean and
          Agile methodologies, that something in the Information Management
          (technology) field would be a good fit for me. After doing a lot of
          research, I resigned from my position and currently have the luxury of
          focusing on completing a Full Stack Certificate though SMU.

            Although I am new to programming, I’ve been told more than once in
            the last few years, that I was born for problem solving. I am
            starting to agree as I am enjoying the program emensely, challenges
            and all. Programmers I know have told me that after working hard –
            frustration and all – that solving the problems enherent to coding,
            is a rush you rarlely get day-to-day in other professions. I’m
            already hooked.
